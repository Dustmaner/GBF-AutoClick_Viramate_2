# GBF-Auto-Skill-Clicker
This program will click skills in viramate for Granblue Fantasy depending on the contents of skills.txt

"1.txt" gives the required information to the program. Please create your own with unique names.

The first number is the delay(ms) between clicks
The rest are the desired skills 

1st number of each row = character position
2nd number of each row = skill number (as in normal view(without viramate))
